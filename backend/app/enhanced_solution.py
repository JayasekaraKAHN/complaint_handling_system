RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
Based on the provided information, this appears to be a complex technical issue requiring specialized analysis. 
Our technical team will investigate the network infrastructure in your area to identify potential causes. 
The issue may be related to network congestion, equipment maintenance, or signal propagation challenges specific to your location.

ESCALATION REQUIRED:
This case has been flagged for technical review due to insufficient pattern matching. 
A field engineer will be assigned to conduct on-site analysis and provide targeted solutions.
